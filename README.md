# Time Spy #

This is a RTS game, similar to Starcraft - with time traveling. This project is VERY old, and most likely never be completed.

### Basics: ###

* Two player RTS with element of time travel
* Two parts to game, first the commander plays, then the spy plays
* Part One: The commander plays a regular RTS game (similar to Starcraft)
* Part Two: The spy plays a stleath game completing various objectives

### Part One: ###

* During part one, the commander can potentially use his “special move” at any point in the game, including more than once. Doing so, he declares that at some point in the past, his spy preformed an action that at the instant occurs. This can be an explosion, an alerting of the terrain, etc.

* If neither commander uses his special move during a game, whoever wins the RTS (aka left alive at the end) wins the game.

* If commander A uses his special move, but commander B does not, and commander B wins the RTS, commander B wins.

* If commander A uses his special move and commander A wins, then the game will enter part two.

* If both commanders use their special move, then the game will enter part two.


### Part Two: ###

* Part two takes place exactly 24 hours before part one. All time triggered fuses have a minimum of 24 hours.

* During this part, there are only two units on the board, each team’s spy. If the team’s commander declared a special move to happen a certain time and location, their spy must complete it at the at/before the exact specified time or lose the game. For example, if the commander declared that a bomb would destroy a certain bridge at 3 pm, then the spy must place a bomb at or before 3 pm the previous day or lose.

* The other team’s spy attempts to carry out his special moves (or lose) while preventing the other spy from preforming his job.

* The spies may not alter any part of the terrain unless stated by the commander or lose the match.
